## Overview
Introduction to Threads

## Details

**Thread** is a ==*sequence of instructions*==

Normal sequential program will use 1 thread.

A single program however, can have 
 - ==*Different threads responsible for different roles*== (web browsers)
 - ==*Multiple threads responsible for the same roles*== (my tool at AWN)

Why Threads? [[Concurrent]] ! (This is different but includes Parallelism which is strictly hardware and is actually working at the same time using multiple cores)

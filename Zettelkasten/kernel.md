## Kernel

- Part of operating system that responds to syscalls, interrupts, and exceptions
- Part of OS that is always running from boot-up to shut down.

**Types of Kernel
1. Monolithic Kernel: Includes devices drivers, file system, virtual mem, etc. This is the normal kernel used in many OSs.
2. Microkernel: Only absolutely necessary components are a part of the kernel.
3. Real-time OS: (is different from [[real-time]]) an OS with stringent event reponse times, guarantees, and preemptive scheduling. **basically what is used in planes etc**

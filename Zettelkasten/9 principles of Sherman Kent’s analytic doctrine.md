tags: #books #cybersec #cti 

---

#### 1. Focus on Policymaker Concerns
	- Accomodate policymakers (clients)
		- Produce assessments timed to their decision cycle
		- Produce assessments focused on their learning curve.
			- Actionable intelligience. Concise and simple to understand.
	- Anticipate policymakers
		- Attentive to problems not yet on the policymaker's minds.
#### 2. Avoidance of a Personal Policy Agenda
	- Consider all cases, no matter how low the probability is.
	- This forces the policymakers to choose.
#### 3. Intellectual Rigor
	- Rigorously evaluaate information for validity and diagnosticity
		- Validity (counter Denial & Deception in information)
		- Diagnosticity (manage "noise" in information)
		- Uncertainties must be made explicit and accounted
#### 4. Conscious Effort to Avoid Analytic Biases
	- Strict No Bias Policy
		- Resist the tendency to see what you expect to see in the information.
		- Avoid "been-to" bias
			- Prior experience is valuable, but today is a new day.
		- Make assumptions explicit and challenge them vigorously
#### 5. Willingness to Consider Other Judgements
	- Argue and even dissent (to have differing opinion)
		- AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE BASIS THAT IS CLEAR
			- Such as alternative assumptions and different interpretations of information
#### 6. Systematic Use of Outside Experts
	- This is a no brainer. Why do scholars practice peer reviews?
#### 7. Collective Responsibility for Judgement
	- Analysts presenting their findings should have represent and defend the appropriate corporate point of view.
		- Bring everyone on to the responsibility ship
#### 8. Effective communication of policy-support information and judgments
	- Avoid lack of clarity and the lack of clear direction
		- In Kent's view, may or could is basically saying an event may happen in probability 0 < P < 100

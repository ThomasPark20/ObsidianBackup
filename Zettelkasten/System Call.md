# System Call


## What
- interface between user process and the kernel
- various languages have their own system call library for using OS services


## When


## How

1. Interrupts
	- ==generated by devices== when they need attention
2. Exceptions
	- ==caused by instruction execuition== when running program needs attention

#### Interrupts
- raised by devices (hardware)
	- e.g. system clock , WIFI card got a packet, SSD accessed some data
- causes the processor to ==transfer control== to a fixed location in memory (depends on the processor) where an ==**interrupt handler**== must be located
- causes the processor to switch in to priviledged mode and use kernel stack.

#### Exceptions
- ==conditions== (not necessarily errors) ==that occur during the execution of a program instruction== 
	- e.g. overflow, illegal instructions, illegal address, page faults, system calls.
- Same as interrupts, sent to a specific ==**exception handler**==

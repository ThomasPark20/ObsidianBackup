##### Axiom 1
- For every intrusion **event** there exists an ==adversary== taking a step towards an intended goal by using a ==capability== over ==infrastructure== against a ==victim== to produce a result.

##### ==Event==
- discrete time-bound activity restricted to a specific phase where...
	- an *adversary*, requiring external *resources*, uses a *capability* and *methodology* over some *infrastructure* against a *victim* with a given *result*
- ==Core Features==
	- adversary
	- capability
	- infrastructure
	- victim
- ==Meta-Features== 
	- timestamp (start and end)
	- phase
	- result
	-

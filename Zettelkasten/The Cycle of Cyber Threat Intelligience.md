![[TheIntelligienceCycle.png]]

## Planning and Direction

1. Intelligience Requirements
	- What people from the organzation need from the CTI team.
		1. Gaps or Questions that need to be addressed.
	- Examples
		1. Strategic
			 - What business units are at most risk to cyber crime?
				 - (Maybe Sales, customer facing departments with customer data)
		 2. Operational
			 - What activity groups are currently active in our industry?
				 - (Revil, Lazarus Group, many other thru IABs)
		 3. Tactical
			 - What adversary behaviors should security focus on to identify threats that are the most likely to breach our organization?

- Identify what threats or adversaries may target which department or what data of our organization.

3. Collection Management Framework
	 - Where are we getting the data? How is it processed? How is it delivered? What questions are we asking of the data?
	 - I.E. What requirements can we fulfill using these data?
	 - ==What is the ingestion and analysis pipeline of our threat intel operation?==

There is lock guide + what kevin got from other prof

A1 Guide presentation 4 pages



**spinlocks vs locks**

spinlock -> we are spinning to check to see if lock avail
lock -> we just wait not spin

spinlock not necessarily always slower than locks

for smaller tasks, spinlock would be faster. (for heavy task like opening stuff from ssd or accessing the web, spinlock would be spinning for a while..)

spinlock = OS controls
lock = thread controls

**thread states**

ready -> ready queue

wait -> wait channels (manyyyyy wait channels per devices like mouse, nic, etc)

**Semaphore**

lock has held or available state. 
semaphore is counting.  (number of resources I have available)
- P: if the semaphore value is greater than 0, decrement it (acquire)
- V: increment the value of the semaphore (release)

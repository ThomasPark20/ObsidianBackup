# Jazzy Rev chall1
Jazzy's ctf package rev chall1. used in UWCTF S22 (in the CTF its named chall2)

## Thought Process
Nothing much here

## Summary
When looking at source code, the flag existed as 
`#define FLAG "\x0cN\x11\x18\x13L \x1d\x06\x0bL \x07O\r N\x0c O\x1dJ\x1c*\rL"`

This is ASCII encoded, but not machine readable. 
The actual main function checks if input is equal to the FLAG after XOR-ing each character in input with 0x7f.

```
for(int i=0; i<strlen(argv[1]); i++ ){  
   if( (argv[1][i] ^ 0x7f) != FLAG[i] ){  
      printf("OOps!! Wrong password\n");  
      return 1;  
   }
```

Ran it in [[IDA]]. 
```
# The intersting parts
add     rax, rdx -> rdx is probably the counter? (i)
movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax] 
xor     eax, 7Fh -> xor
mov     ecx, eax
mov     eax, [rbp+var_14]
cdqe
lea     rdx, unk_40204D
movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax+rdx] -> grab the char in FLAG?
cmp     cl, al
```
In IDA, 0x7f existed as
```
movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax]
xor     eax, 7Fh
```

Which I assume first line assigns eax to the character currently comparing and next line performs xor. This value was then compared to the character at same position of our FLAG (saw in source code)

The FLAG was referred to as `unk_40204D`

Searching for this yielded:

This was definitely intersting. After digging around, It was found that h stood for bytes... Not too sure on that still but the 2 digits before h is actually ASCII in hexform after XOR-ing with 0x7f!! 
`\x0C` - Apply XOR again -> `\x73` - Hex to ASCII -> `s`
This can be known by focusing on the 2nd line. 
`4Eh == N` Means correlation. After investigation, `0x4E == ASCII N` !!! So I learned this was ASCII. 
After applying XOR to all the following and performing hex to ASCII,
we get `goose{s1ngl3_byt3_x0r_1s_0b5cUr3}`
